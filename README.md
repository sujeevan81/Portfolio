# My Portfolio

This is my second portolio in line. This time I wanted to try something new. So I forked out the Modern Portfolio repo from Brad Traversy's open source project and made some amendments to it. I changed the personal details and the color scheme. I also added a new button to download my cv and included a new sections to showcase my programming language skills. This website has been epecially designed using the technologies like, HTML5 and CSS3. The effective use of new css grid and flexbox are the main highlights. Morever, in order to speed up production, Sass has been used as the pre-processor.
